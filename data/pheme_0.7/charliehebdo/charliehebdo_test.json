Typical.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] And the majority of Muslims in the West were either born here or came here FOR freedom.

The people doing the drawing weren't Muslims, so the rule doesn't apply. [unused10][SEP][unused10] Discriminate??? Do you mean cherry pick?[SEP][unused10] Stop for a second and think. Since there's no law against what they did, you're saying it was ok to kill them? [unused10][SEP][unused10] People deserve respect, belief systems/religion doesn't.

I'm sure the killers searched their \"heart\" and look what happened.[SEP][unused10] &gt;shouldn't be considered \"sacred\" anymore.[SEP][unused10] And you say we should respect everyones beliefs. I gave you an example. The Klan. Should we respect their beliefs?[SEP][unused10] Did I say they did?[SEP][unused10] You are claiming I should respect all people and their beliefs. I'm saying no, I don't. The Klan believes things too.[SEP][unused10] No use repeating this \"soul\" BS without proof. So you're a \"do as I say, don't do as I do\" -type of guy, huh?[SEP].[unused10] If a tribe from Papua New Guinea said that's trees, &amp; subsequently paper, is \"sacred\" to them, would you stop wiping your ass?[SEP].[unused10] That magazine satirised every major religion and world leader, yet only one of those groups murdered 13 people.

Thankfully.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] These things are international and crossing borders anyway. They are actually #universal, but let's stick to earth ;)[SEP][unused10] So don't ridicule Christ, ridicule Bible.[SEP][unused10] U said I don't hold anything sacred &amp; I said I do. You know what it is? Paper. Better to keep an extra shirt with u from now on.[SEP][unused10] Muhammad was a pedophile. Says so in the quran. :-D \"Did nothing wrong\" haha[SEP][unused10] And so should anyone living in the 21st century. We're done with myths, time for facts.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Well you can bet and you may be right, but the laughers are fools too, as are the drawers, who crossed many limits.[SEP][unused10] You forgot the consept \"sincerety\". Must be difficult.[SEP][unused10] Sorry to come back to this, but have you read Deuteronomy and Leviticus? These are the laws you respect? Or sharia?[SEP][unused10] Ok, only one I've seen so far.[SEP][unused10] :-D Stupidest tweet of the day! You want to go with the \"divine\" law? Sharia? Haha Did you read your tweet before pressing send?[SEP][unused10] And he seems to be far from smart, when Some who are considered holy and widely loved, can be insulted like that. [unused10][SEP][unused10] The funny thing is (or actually sad), that you still fail to see that I'm not defending anyon, just condemning #CharlieHebdo, too.[SEP][unused10] As many as I need to. How many times are you gonna mention this non-existent soul?[SEP][unused10] Bullying a belief? :-D [unused10][SEP][unused10] No, you have been talking about beliefs, not me. Take your narcissistic head out of your arse and see the outside for a while.[SEP][unused10] If you're offended by something I say, it's really your problem.

France is not an Islamic country. [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] He is, unfortunately. Bullying shouldn't be accepted in the name of freedom of speech. #CharlieHebdo[SEP][unused10] No, why you're asking? :D[SEP][unused10] Never said they are. People deserve respect. Myths, fables and imaginary beings don't. [unused10][SEP][unused10] No! You're not! #tweetlikeasixyearold Hmmm, maybe you ARE a comedian after all.[SEP][unused10] Well maybe not 100 times, but more civilised absolutely. The U.S. is not on MY civilised countries list. Most of it anyway.[SEP][unused10] But if I did, I'd do wrong, and the correct thing would be to correct me then.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] No, he's much worse than a douchebag.[SEP][unused10] So that's \"common sense\" as you define it. Riiiiight[SEP][unused10] Disrespect of an idea, a belief. There's a huge difference with disrespecting humans. [unused10][SEP][unused10] No, actually he's not. Making fun/satirising myths, fables, ideas, goes with the freedom of speech. [unused10][SEP][unused10] Well that #CharlieHebdo thing should have been outlawed, but yes, if one has common sense, one understands.[SEP][unused10] That's why, for the umpteenth time, it's A B-A-D A-N-A-L-O-G-Y[SEP][unused10] [unused10] And once again, saying about an issue, or meaningfully insulting about something, are different things.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Not certainly pseudo-cultural or pseudo-intellectual bullism. Who r u, who am I, who r they must nt be above respect.[SEP][unused10] If they had been doing it only about a single (actual) person the law would have interfered. And rightly so. [unused10][SEP][unused10] Ihmeiden aika ei ole ohi. Olen p\u00e4\u00e4ministerin kanssa kerrankin samaa mielt\u00e4.[SEP][unused10] Besides, Christ is not the belief system. A Christian god is and according to the bible he's an asshole.[SEP][unused10] Wow, you got to use the word \"bully\" twice in this tweet. #notevenbullying[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Why? Would it make it more right, if Rolle would bully also Niilo and Asko, besides Ismo?[SEP][unused10] Maybe french laws, which is stupid, from #France. #CharlieHebdo[SEP][unused10] Not at all. What happened in between the break, I feel you're getting more lower and lack any kind of essence from your posts?[SEP][unused10] Nice assumption. Let's say I hold the equality of all humans, men, women, LGBT sacred. Most religions are against that. -&gt;[SEP][unused10] Repeating myself? You keep bringing up this non-existent \"soul\".[SEP][unused10] Are you saying it can't be sacred to me? Things evolve, we should too. A book written by people who didn't know what stars were&gt;[SEP][unused10] You're the only one claiming the cartoons were \"bullying\". They are not. [unused10][SEP][unused10] Well most haven't (fortunately) seen all the pics, and it's a stupid trend and a rootless ignorance, too. #FreeVietnam[SEP][unused10] Another completely failed #CircularArgument.[SEP][unused10] So what's the con then???[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I'm a non religious too &amp; also convinced that religion is bullshit, but people that belong to it aren't full of shit.[SEP][unused10] Yes, it will, no doubt about that, and do not worry my little friend :D[SEP][unused10] Yeah, and you're being sarcastic two messages in a row and avoiding the point with it completely![SEP][unused10] Bed time for me. Will return. Bye for now. :-)[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I might not know better word, but could write about it more than 140 letters easily. And only one? Knowledge?[SEP][unused10] If it truly was a #religionofpeace wouldn't their extremists be extremely peaceful? #islam  [unused10][SEP][unused10] Like I said, first you have to prove a \"soul\" exists, before you can even advice me what to do with it.[SEP][unused10] I wonder who's doing this and if the people in the market drew a picture? [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] One of most important things humans have in common is: difference! Learn to respect that above unilateral emancipation.[SEP][unused10] Bullying??? The whole world should stop questioning (religious) ideas, coz 20% of the people might get offended? [unused10][SEP][unused10] If anything, the police is not going to paradise. [unused11][SEP][unused10] Why not? He was killed in the line of duty, heroic death. The killer was doing what the quran tells him to do.[SEP][unused10] Prove a negative? Prove something there's no proof of, doesn't exist? Prove to me unicorns don't exist.[SEP][unused10] I know a lot already from this conversation, but what prevents you of stopping?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] It was still completely tasteless and stupid. Now they are dead.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] We'll end up with this. [unused11][SEP][unused10] Unless Niilo, Asko and Ismo are belief systems, I don't see the comparison. [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] So should one be able to bully as much as one wants in school, because of #FreedomOfSpeech?[SEP][unused10] Well it is, as you're still referring to quran as it would mean something in our conversation.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] That's not good, that's wrong, and can be ridiculed.[SEP][unused10] Please, stop with the condescending bull shit. You know nothing of me or what I enjoy. #spiritguide[SEP][unused10] No, I thought you're smarter than that, I underestimated you, sorry. Forget the \"Divine\" then, just focus on the nature/natural.[SEP][unused10] How? She's/he's nameless, faceless? \"If\" there isn't a maker, who will she/he be responsible to? Do you seriously this his/her-&gt;[SEP][unused10] I mean, you don't want to disrespect my beliefs do you?[SEP][unused10] But for example Christ didn't do wrong, only humans in the name of Him. So ridiculing his character, is tasteless and wrong.[SEP][unused10] No, I don't exactly respect dogmas, but doesn't mean I'd go insulting them. But the point was not to insult Christ/Muhammed/etc...[SEP][unused10] Yes, it's true, everybody lost.[SEP][unused10] Why not, it's \"freedom of speech\" to say what one wants, isn't it?[SEP][unused10] :-D Someones shirt? Dude, you need to sacrifice yours I'm afraid. No one's gonna give you their shirt at that point.[SEP][unused10] I disagree. And thank goodness, so does most of the civilised world.[SEP][unused10] I get that, but condemning the victim in this case is to me almost as bad. Who are you to condemn them anyway? They broke no law[SEP][unused10] I'd bet quite a few \"douchebags\" laughed. That makes it hypocrisy. And still they are just cartoons. [unused10][SEP][unused10] If the actions of the cartoonists were lawful (and they were), -&gt;[SEP][unused10] Coz you tweeted all of a sudden this general knowledge tidbit and I was wondering if I had anything to do with this brain fart.[SEP][unused10] No it doesn't, it's a \"freedom of speech\", according to #JeSuisCharlie -people.[SEP][unused10] ----- the point ----&gt;You.[SEP][unused10] Not to me. Like I said, people deserve respect, ideas don't.  [unused10][SEP][unused10] They are victim for the shootings, but wrong doers in the big picture. Along with other extremists, of course.[SEP][unused10] More of this \"soul\" thing, huh?[SEP].[unused10] No, it's a fact. Give me a single peer reviewed piece of evidence that proves any of the 3000 or so gods.[SEP][unused10] You're free to try and change it, move or live with it. There's no ifs or buts. No \"bullies\". Those are your choices. #notsorry[SEP][unused10] I really don't think it will. I doubt he/she believes in your \"spirit\". Worry? Me? Hah.[SEP][unused10] Don't know, hence the word \"if\".[SEP][unused10] No, I understood perfectly. Thanks.[SEP][unused10] Yet these people follow quran more to the letter than a moderate Muslim. The bible is full of hate too. More so [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] How? Why wouldn't for someone spiritual, a belief be more important, than for example looks or other shallow things?[SEP].[unused10] They were even accused of anti-Semitism coz they made fun of Jews. I'm sure the Muslims laughed at those pictures. [unused10][SEP][unused10] No you didn't. I said how I feel about the subject.Do you mean concentrating?Sadly, no I'm not :-([SEP][unused10] How many times you want to repeat that low-level belief of yours?[SEP][unused10] -\u203a and what it came to some of the worst ones: extremely insulting and obscenely ugly.[SEP][unused10] No one should be silenced in case they might hurt someones \"important sacred\" thingies.[SEP][unused10] \"If you don't want your beliefs to be ridiculed, don't have such ridiculous beliefs\" - someone [unused10][SEP][unused10] Well alcoholics who choose welfare and prostitutes and school bullies might not brake law \u2013 I still not approve their doings.[SEP][unused10] \"aggression problem\" That's quite an understatement, but yes, yes there is. [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] Sky fairies is your unnecessary rhetorics. For many people some things are sacred, whether you understand it or not.[SEP][unused10] So the quran had nothing to do with the mindset of the killers? Ah, so you're an apologist. Makes sense.[SEP][unused10] Blasphemy!? A law that an omnipotent, omniscient being wont get his feelings hurt. What a joke!! :-D [unused10][SEP][unused10] Yes, but many denominations of Christianity believe that god, christ, holy spirit all same thing, god. #generalknowledgetidbit[SEP][unused10] Sure, when you learn to use these in practice, you'll enjoy your life more.[SEP][unused10] Don't believe everything what quran says, and especially, don't believe everything you read from the #internet.#FreeAdvice[SEP][unused10] [unused10] #Mohammad didn't write #Quran, #Christ didn't write #Bible.#Islam#Christianity#Dogmas#Ignorance[SEP][unused10] You mean people like this?  [unused10] [unused11][SEP][unused10] Ah, another \"general knowledge tidbit\". I'm starting to enjoy them.[SEP][unused10] I didn't say anything about wrong doings. Don't move the goalposts. We've been talking about beliefs the whole time.[SEP][unused10] Again, just your beliefs. You can believe in this \"spirit\" mumbo jumbo and I can ridicule it.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] No, a law, that majority of people (and all existing cultures), would have right to have smt sacred still.[SEP][unused10] No it isn't, I should have known better; you're just one more christian atheist dissapointed.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Yup, but for someone to whom nothing is sacred, this might be too difficult to understand.[SEP][unused10] But if you did disrespect it, I'd defend your right to say how you feel about it.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Pointing out those things, is naturally ok. Involving obscene blasphemy and grossness, is not.[SEP][unused10] Good to know.[SEP][unused10] Same here, need some sleep now.[SEP][unused10] And no they didn't. One could say \"heart full of anger\", but digging deep and searching the essence will cleanse it.[SEP][unused10] There's probably leafs or someones shirt nearby for help.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] But it seems you haven't anything, and if you did, sincerely, I'd try not to disrespect it.[SEP][unused10] :-D Double standards much? He did exactly the same thing. Blasphemy. He's not dead though. Yet.[SEP][unused10] Prove to me your version of god exists and he's worth worshipping and then I'll consider not ridiculing him/her/it [unused10][SEP][unused10] Agreed. Much worse than anything anyone ever drew on paper. Yet he/she can express her/his feelings. [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] Surely not.[SEP][unused10] &gt;just say it's a sad day when that happens and then we won't have freedom anymore. [unused10][SEP][unused10] There, I just gave it chance. No sign of it. You know why? Coz it doesn't exists.[SEP][unused10] &gt; but it's ok, we now know you have double standards. #hypocrite #limitsandscalesman[SEP][unused10] Same thing, if you search it deep enough from inside your soul, you'll easily understand. But okay; would Mandela agree with those?[SEP][unused10] I don't know what kind of school you went to, but the school bullies I've seen rarely were into \"words\" or arguments.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Seems that in you mr.Tuo/mio (yours/mine), you are more mine. I'll leave u 2 gentlemen go on. Markus nice to meet you.[SEP][unused10] Here you're partly right, and defo it was #incorrect to kill anyone, but to accept what they draw and martyring them, is wrong too.[SEP][unused10] Not many good reasons, though some nice guidelines if one can discriminate.[SEP][unused10] Show me a law that says they crossed a limit.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] That's your belief, for which you have freedom, though it might be silly.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] The proof is inside of our selves, and only there. Prove it to your self and stop being childish. You'd enjoy it.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I know. Tragical, but doesn't make much difference which profession/religion he/she has in this case.[SEP][unused10] If someone is attacking beliefs, he has the right to do so. If he's attacking a person, he doesn't.[SEP][unused10] Again, where did I say it was? Or is this another one of your \"general knowledge tidbits\"?[SEP][unused10] It's not about the books, it's about God, and in the end, it doesn't make much difference to know the stars, but to know one self.[SEP].[unused10] Once we start telling what you can and can't say, we no longer have #FreedomOfSpeech That would be a disaster.[SEP][unused10] Exactly, I just point them out, don't go shooting people. [unused10][SEP][unused10] You hold it a human right, not a sacred thing. The other things has roots in centuries and millenniums back.[SEP][unused10] :-D :-D So you ARE a comedian.[SEP][unused10] Hehe, had to come back to this. Can you see the desperation in your tweet? Clasping for straws much? \"Divine law\" :-D[SEP][unused10] No, because he's dead. Killed by another Muslim. Guess they'll meet in paradise, huh? [unused10][SEP][unused10] One should find the \"rules\" from one's heart, then common sense occurs. Not from mind, but heart.[SEP][unused10] Really, you should stop with this analogy. It makes no sense.[SEP][unused10] Yup, you had, as you suddenly started brain farting some stuff about some books, and it even lasted some time.[SEP][unused10] &gt; discussing the content of the cartoons is a lot like discussing what the woman was wearing when she got raped.[SEP][unused10] &gt; conscience is going to give him/her trouble for that? He/She believes he's/she's right. #belief #religion[SEP][unused10] Certainly, but you can give it a chance; find it and realize it, so you don't have to believe, you'll just comfortably know.[SEP][unused10] Again, why should I live by the rules someone randomly thinks of? The law I get, it's thought of and mostly agreed on.[SEP][unused10] &gt; country that doesn't have it. There's plenty to choose from. Or. 2. Try to change things democratically. I'll -&gt; [unused10][SEP][unused10] &gt; I think everything's been said and maybe a bit more. I also think it's clear neither of us will change their mind.[SEP][unused10] Btw, if you believe in the bible you're going to hell. You called them fools. Google it, if you can't remember your scripture.[SEP]Correct. Bullying shouldn't be approved in the name of freedom of speech. #CharlieHebdo did wrong too. [unused10] [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] \"Certainly had the right\"... well, according to you and some others, yes, then again according to some others, not.[SEP][unused10] Yes, rudeness is weak mans imitation of strentgh.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Yup, but these #immoral \"artists\" at #CharlieHebdo, did much worse things without any taste or limits.[SEP][unused10] By the way, that's a police officer they're executing.And a Muslim. [unused10][SEP][unused10] Sure. On the other hand, I'm also right.[SEP][unused10] No I didn't, you just won't get it.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] So should a bully have a right to bully his class mate, because of #FreedomOfSpeech?[SEP][unused10] If your faith/religion is so weak that it can't handle cartoons, no matter what they depict, not much of a religion [unused10][SEP][unused10] Like I've said (probably many times), it cannot be proven, but only to one self. Please stop repeating yourself.[SEP][unused10] Well \"civilized\" can be seen in far different ways. For me middle class Indian is 100 times more civilized than mid-class american.[SEP][unused10] I'm not saying it can't be, but if your beliefs are unsubstantiated, I have the right to ridicule them. Not him/her, the beliefs[SEP][unused10] You must be good.Now there's some sarcasm for you ;-)[SEP][unused10] My opinion, the opinion of a civilised society and the way the law sees it. BOOM. Sorry.[SEP][unused10] I actually corrected it.[SEP][unused10] There's no point in your bully nonsense. It's a bad analogy. You bully. #seeiusedittwicetoo[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Sure, there are scales and limits. #CharlieHebdo crossed many, but of course doesn't justify killings.[SEP][unused10] Is this \"soul\" business something they tell you in these \"spirit\" classes?[SEP][unused10] Besides, you're still the only one calling what they did \"bullying\" [unused10][SEP][unused10] Prove to me a soul exists. Gibberish. [unused10][SEP][unused10] Not sure what you're meaning here, please explain, got curious.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] But it's wrong. Why would it ought to be?[SEP][unused10] Is it? Which god is that. I'm really more interested why the stars are there, than any book of bull shit.[SEP][unused10] Of course, who would blindly accept anything, especially dogmas.[SEP][unused10] Have could I prove you that love, other emotions or for example mind exists?[SEP][unused10] You just contradicted yourself.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Nothing sacred to you, but you fail to understand, that lots of sacred to some others. #understanding #respect[SEP][unused10] -\u203a of theirs, and saying that their \"art\" was (at least partly) discusting, immoral, not needed, uncalled, non beneficial -\u203a[SEP][unused10] So people can stop calling it a #religionofpeace. Thanks, I'll tell them. [unused10][SEP][unused10] This is not needed. I'm not anyhow justifying the terror attacks and the deaths, just not accepting the martyrism or heroism -\u203a[SEP][unused10] Again, they broke no law. You didn't answer me, who are you to condemn them, if they broke no law?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Well the reactions of course vary, only a fool rages, but it still doesn't make severe disrespect correct.[SEP][unused10] Are you telling me the claims for any god are not unsubstantiated? Go on then, give evidence proving any god.[SEP][unused10] Hit a nerve?[SEP][unused10] In the civilised world? Can you show me some statistics?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Really? I'm the only one? #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm[SEP][unused10] [unused10] and who is the one deciding What is offence and What freedom if speech, you?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Gagged and good-taste-and-respectfulness-expected are two different things. Again and still.[SEP][unused10] :-D[SEP].[unused10] If this Allan akubar exists, those cartoonist would suffer forever after their NATURAL death. That knowledge should be enough.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] H\u00f6psis. There should be limits to everything, also to restrictions, but have respect and understanding towards others.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Well that's your opinion, and your still in far minority with that \"belief\". #Luckily[SEP][unused10] I meant that this kind of actions can and should be ridiculed, and for about fifth time, I have never justified any killings.[SEP][unused10] There should be limits to things, but not free speech. [unused10][SEP][unused10] Yes, you see the man made laws, not the Divine laws nor even \"laws of nature\".[SEP][unused10] Silly argument. But I answered to this already with the alcoholic welfare guy- / prostitue- / school bully example.[SEP][unused10] It's not a fact, but your belief. The only proof is inside of your soul, and only you can find it, no-one will find it for you.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] you are confusing  freedom of speech with freedom to offend[SEP][unused10] Then your answer was absurd.[SEP][unused10] Why would anyone be?[SEP][unused10] So we can bully our class mates now?[SEP][unused10] Well, if Christ and god are the same thing, as many believe, he did plenty wrong.[SEP][unused10] First one I've talked to. Why the sarcasm? It makes you look weak.[SEP][unused10] We shouldn't accept nor respect wrong or wrong doings, but no reason to insult for example Christ or Muhammed. They did no wrong.[SEP][unused10] Ah :-( So you aren't :-/[SEP][unused10] But will you be able to answer this, or?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Heh, maybe you have to stop now. Where did I say anything like it was ok to kill them?[SEP][unused10] I take offence how the Muslims treat women and minorities, yet they are free to preach about it-&gt; freedom of speech [unused10][SEP][unused10] Tell that to the jihadists. Who are u to tell anyone what to believe from the quran? Don't you respect their beliefs? #hypocrite[SEP][unused10] Never said that. Just coz I see through the bull shit that is religion, doesn't mean that. [unused10][SEP][unused10] You reall continue even with this?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Sure, they can not be killed multiple times. But it's true, there is aggression problem in extreme jihadists.[SEP][unused10] No, I don't see the point in your faulty \"school ground bullying\" analogy.[SEP][unused10] I did, in my next tweet. Besides I'm still laughing at this gem [unused11][SEP][unused10] There's nothing to understand. Just unsubstantiated claims. [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] \"Everyones beliefs\", and the main religions central path, are again those famous #TwoDifferentThings[SEP][unused10] There's scales and limits in sarcasm, too. This your post has more sarcasm, than the mine you're answering, don't you think?[SEP][unused10] Tasteless? Stupid? Depends who u ask. But they certainly had the right to say it.Yes they are dead, murdered by theists.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Making fun / questioning, and being excessively vulgar, disrespectful and rude, are two completely different things.[SEP][unused10] Sure I am, but also a philosopher. It was poorly expressed earlier.[SEP][unused10] No you don't &amp; you can't. Just like I don't have to believe in your \"soul\" coz you can't prove it.[SEP][unused10] If they had been satirising only Islam/Muslims, I'd kinda see your point. [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] In this case not, because of #ingnorance. Holy war actually means war against the enemies of ones #soul.[SEP][unused10] Yeah, if you don't know, now you know ;)[SEP][unused10] Yeah, just like any theist in the world. \"Oh, I just know. He lives in my soul.\" :-D[SEP][unused10] &gt;will you defends me like this when I shoot as many theists as I possibly can? #hypotheticalsituation[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused11][SEP][unused10] Not in my / most of the civilised worlds book. Offence can not be given, it can only be taken. [unused10][SEP][unused10] If you broke a law, yes. I wouldn't argue your right to say it though.[SEP][unused10] You are confusing freedom of speech with freedom to offend what to others is inviolable or sacrosanct. #CharlieHebdo[SEP][unused10] [unused10] So if a bully bullies also others, anyone shouldn't feel offended?[SEP][unused10] If believe something, a cartoon shouldn't be able to shake that belief. Nothing sacred about Mohammad. [unused10][SEP][unused10] I don't need to guess, but descending for these conversations after your low blows makes me feel bit silly that's true.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] You'll see, easily, if you want. It's about hurting someones deep feelings and important sacred things.[SEP][unused10] No, there's no business and there's no classes.[SEP][unused10] You might offend something I hold \"sacred\", but I'll fight for your right to say it. [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] The limits are set by the common sense of the wise.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Why? Did you get it wrong what I meant? And why sarcasm, it's again just proof of weakness.[SEP][unused10] Lol, why would I be that interested what the bible says? :D[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Or actually correction here; they are set by Someone else, but can be understood by those wise who have common sense.[SEP][unused10] But since it's a different thing to different people, we'll end up in a society that can't ridicule anything. [unused10][SEP][unused10] Never heard of Charlie hebdo before, now you can not see those pictures. So that worked well. Seen quite a few.[SEP][unused10] \"Thinking is no means of knowing the absolute truth\"[SEP][unused10] Sure, but the happy thing for me is that I don't have to believe in it, I just know it. #Lucky &amp; #Blessed[SEP][unused10] Like I said, thankfully disrespect is still included in the freedom of speech. And it ought to be. [unused10][SEP][unused10] If 1 is offended by my views, it's her/his problem. Mute me on twitter. Doesn't give you a right to kill me though. [unused10][SEP][unused10] It's all scales and limits with you. Sarcasm is sarcasm, apparently I'm not allowed to do it and you're. -&gt;[SEP][unused10] I don't have to. But to have proof and knowledge of the #Spirit for oneself, is everything. I sincerely recommend.[SEP][unused10] Ok. I think we're done here anyway. I will read your tweets and think about them, but won't comment any further. -&gt;[SEP][unused10] Satire is probably the oldest for of ridiculing the powers that be. Nothing someone says gives the \"butt hurt\" a right to kill.[SEP][unused10] That's again your belief/opinion. Can you see there's starting to be repetition pattern here?[SEP][unused10] Even though it's actually not a belief, you call call it silly all you want. Because of #freedomofspeech[SEP][unused10] [unused10] That's not the point, but to respect (also) those who have something sacred in their lives. You can ridicule theories.[SEP][unused10] So the French law is stupid? :-D Should it be replaced with sharia? #notacomedian[SEP][unused10] Well it's stupid for those who won't get it. I told you, I underestimated you. Forget fairies, think Mandela or Gandhi then.[SEP][unused10] Christ is a son of God, as many believes, but lets not get into that, as you don't believe it.[SEP][unused10] Did I ever say, it would give? Are you focusing at all, or maybe drunk?[SEP][unused10] I've already told, that the only proof is inside one's soul. No use repeating these things over and over.[SEP][unused10] And according to the law, yes. :-)[SEP][unused10] Viva la difference!

So so obviously.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] no not your tweet, the one you replied to[SEP][unused10] I cannot see why making fun of Islam is in itself racist, though it may be definitely motivated by racism. #CharlieHebdo[SEP][unused10] Some people just need to get a sense of humour.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] so you're saying that they would be more deserving of death? Troubling implication[SEP][unused10] And yet if your first reaction to hearing about the shooting is to tweet that it is a racist mag, that in itself is telling.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] \"if it was the official magazine of the BNP it would have been just as bad\".  Speak for yourself.[SEP][unused10] ...and the only logical conclusion is justification. You could understand why people should find that so abhorrent.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] wow.[SEP][unused10] It's basically a variant of \"you're with us or against us\".

Really??! #CharlieHebdo[SEP][unused10] the article he wrote about how the media shouldn't use this attack as an excuse to scapegoat Muslims. He tweeted it earlier.[SEP][unused10] You may label anti-cleric jokes stupid,but calling it racist is off the mark, in today's context.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Islam isn't a race. It's a religion.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] name all the races for me. Describe what makes a race. Then we can assess your point.[SEP][unused10] \"the only logical conclusion is justification\".  Of course, that is not logical.  There's a long history of such non-sequiturs.[SEP][unused10] If that context mattered in 'the last few days', it matters today.  I have no time for 'a decent interval' etc.[SEP][unused10] it is.  It's telling that I think people are tacitly acknowleding that Charlie Hebdo's racism *might* be a factor here.[SEP][unused10] Might yes.
