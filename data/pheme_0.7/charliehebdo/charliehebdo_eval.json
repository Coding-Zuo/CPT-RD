Pathetic.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Sure thing but there is nothing racist here. Religion is not a race. I despise Christianity, Islam, Buddhism etc.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I know it's a delicate line, no one denies that. But it's necessary. IMHO religion deserves no intellectual respect[SEP][unused10] [unused10] oh yes the great Western values, up held by the CIA in Abu Graib[SEP][unused10] Defending freedom of religion is not the same as endorsing religion or holding it as sacred.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] This is mostly OK but changes nothing.

And no you're not \"free\" at least in physiological sense.[SEP][unused10] You don't need to understand a work of art to express solidarity with its creators after they are murdered for it.[SEP][unused10] My point is logical. Freedom of opinion requires, *by definition*, its absoluteness. Otherwise you are no more free.[SEP][unused10] That's why we listed them. We read it.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Like anti-Semitism?

Do you consider yourself racist because you speak against fascism and you mock it?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] You don't bridge the divide by self censorship. You bridge it by allowing both to freely express.[SEP].[unused10] maybe they think it wrong to publish offensive racist images designed to offend as many Muslims as possible?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] You know the background of CH people, do you? They are hardcore left wingers, not neocons.[SEP][unused10] whole point of the cartoons is to attack Islam in the most offensive manner, what context is that not hate speech?

Life of Brian censored.[SEP][unused10] Haha okay, I've been trolled. Nice job. :)[SEP][unused10] there's no such thing as 'race' its a political construct - there's only 1 race and that's the human race [unused10][SEP][unused10] the are more difference between individuals than between 'races' [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] It's hardly essential. Armed men broke into a media office and murdered people. How is that not enough?[SEP][unused10] Because \"shocking the audience would be wrong\". No problem publishing the images of the policeman execution though.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] U can always rationalize fear. There's always an easy way out for cowards, that's why they so often take it.[SEP][unused10] saying Islam is a terrorist religion is not defending freedom of speech[SEP][unused10] [unused10] However mocking the Jewish *religion* is not antisemitism. Mocking the Jews as an *ethnicity* is.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Also, you can publish them to give the context, even if you disagree with them. Just state it.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] They are not racist. They mock religion and extremism. And they are required to know context.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Not reprinting it accomplishes the fundamentalism victory. Christian or Islamic or whatever.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] but as far as I know no-one's publishing them. Well not in UK. Need to Google that though as I don't buy papers![SEP][unused10] [unused10] U can always rationalize fear. There's always an easy way out for cowards, that's why they take it so often.[SEP][unused10] I'm glad you can tell the difference coz most Muslims/Jews can't [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] Sorry. Didn't mean to mislead you.

But they have to be republished to show we do not give in.[SEP][unused10] Sure. But do you think it is useless to understand a bit more? Do you truly endorse willfull ignorance?[SEP][unused10] its not hard to utterly condemn the murder of journalists and oppose the circulation of racist cartoons [unused10][SEP][unused10] Freedom of anything is not a physical entity/law, it's a privilege. Hence not absolute.[SEP][unused10] No-one publishing them. Seen a couple on Twitter. Don't like them.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Oh ok I thought it was censored *now*.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] so anti Semitism is not racism?[SEP][unused10] Other frauds: fake #crowdfunding .

It's entirely superfluous.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Of course. But not giving essential context for fear to offend? Despicable. You can show &amp; say you disagree[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I lived in UK 2 years and a half and I didn't notice that. I also did not know about LoB. So appalling.[SEP][unused10] yea and that makes it worse - the left should be defending religious freedom[SEP][unused10] Cartoonists are the \"martyrs\" of free speech? Not when you are provoking someone to attack you.[SEP]Frauds = RT [unused10] A great many frauds, the Guardian included, claiming to be \"Charlie Hebdo\" but too cowardly to publish their cartoons[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Hate speech is different from racism. And attacking a religion is attacking a conceptual system, not a race.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] No, UK press not publishing. Stephen Fry appeals for press to publish and Cambridge Professor advises Irish not to.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] This is the same retarded reasoning of those who equate Islam with terrorism, only mirrored.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] What do you mean?
