Or do you think i am a terrorist ??[SEP][unused10] what do they call christian attacks on schools ?? Just like the one carried out by taliban ??[SEP][unused10] [unused10]  I think at your age you know that western media has got an agenda muslims[SEP][unused10] gun control at work.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] no we see worse ... Remember the Norwegian catholics who killed about 100 in a youths camp ? He was labelled 1/2[SEP][unused10] [unused10] as a psychopath... But if they are even muslims who might have dont it, they are extremist and terrorist !![SEP][unused10] [unused10] what about Israel?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Bullshit. Wake up. Read up or shut up. Hamas Fatah Hezbollah amongst others want Israel wiped off the map #terror[SEP][unused10] [unused10] That's because they haven't labeled all attacks by Muslims as terrorist acts![SEP][unused10] [unused10] says who?

The culprit is Islam.[SEP][unused10] religion of peace[SEP][unused10] [unused10] the point of difference was that if a muslim commits a crime most probably will be considered as a terrorist[SEP][unused10] So after making an accusation you should back up with evidence of Christian attacks on schools!![SEP][unused10] [unused10] More like Islam at work.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] this is the 21st century. are human beings not evolving at all? are we still sacages who'd rather kill than live[SEP][unused10] [unused10] who really gives a fuck?

This type of thing happens once every 20 years in France. Twice a year in the USA![SEP][unused10] you reply makes no sense whatsoever wth?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Id challenge Islam because it is a violent religion in its most basic form. Same with Christianity.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] yes it is. West isn't necessarily a geographical region[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Just because it is a delicate subject does not mean that it should be ignored.[SEP][unused10] The real question is where have you ever seen thousands of Christians rejoicing for the killing of innocence?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] easier to support a perceived underdog. Forget that before Israel fired a bullet 10k rockets were fired @ israel![SEP][unused10] [unused10] at war with itself ?? How is that ??[SEP][unused10] [unused10] he was a lunatic. isis is a group that target vulnerable people because they can't fight back[SEP][unused10] so whatever happened to evolution? are we still stuck in the dark ages? why can't people accept not everyone is the same?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] You're speaking ahistorical gibberish.
