Do you want me to find another one for you?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] One little (Not little) fact keeps getting dismissed! Young man is dead. Dead! #StayFocusedonTheTopic #Ferguson[SEP][unused10] and then shooting him. Yes. That's pretty bad. But you don't care because he's white and you are racist[SEP][unused10] it's on many different websites[SEP][unused10] [unused10] no he's not he's informing us in what's going on so we can brainstorm[SEP][unused10] [unused10] corrupt cops of all races are dangerous.

Lol i can't take you serious dude.[SEP]Killing someone in self defense isn't a crime. That seems to be what happened here. [unused10] #Ferguson[SEP][unused10] what should be done about law enforcement committing murder against unarmed Black people?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Eric garner was killed on camera and the cop had not been punished yet[SEP]Ohio Peace Officer academy class BAS 09-058, graduated sept. '09 - received commission in Jan.

God help you[SEP][unused10] [unused10] shockingly it is true &amp; surpisingly he is free, but he was FIRED from PD [unused11][SEP][unused10] please post a real story of a Black cop in uniform killing an unarmed white teen..can u do that,if it's just about \"bad cops\"[SEP][unused10] [unused10] when Black people get caught committing crimes against white people they usually go to jail.No paid leave 4 them[SEP][unused10] [unused10] my last names Lopez[SEP][unused10] so it needs to be a specific method of killing?[SEP][unused10] I can, but nobody cares about a white guy getting killed buy a black cop[SEP][unused10] so are u saying Blacks are more prone to crime?[SEP][unused10] again,what should happen to all these cops harming Blk people? Or SHOULD they be punished in your opinion?[SEP][unused10] the same way you stop the 93% of whites killed by other whites..[SEP][unused10] [unused10] no such thing for all I know profiling of black men has been going on for centuries so I'm not tryna hear that[SEP][unused10] So its not about race? Please name me ONE CASE of a Black cop on duty killing an unarmed white teen..Just ONE CASE[SEP]All black ppl are put in a category. Have u or your friends been told not to date \"black guys\" ? [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] Punish them on a case by case basis based on the facts of the case. Refrain from labeling an entire group of people.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] who said that?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] and do those blacks go unpunished ?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] what are you talking about?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] too fucking bad dude when your people decide to judge us all we have the right to retaliate[SEP][unused10] no they are not..Unarmed white teens don't get gunned down over and over by Black cops..you posting one fake story isn't proof[SEP][unused10] You are in Jim Crow 2.0 because that is where the banksters want you. It's Divide &amp; Conquer. Find out who the real enemy is[SEP]I can also assure you that no cops that I know are in the KKK. And the majority of the cops I know are black. [unused10][SEP][unused10] this is an article of what happened in FERGUSON,MO [unused11][SEP][unused10] are you really incapable of understanding what the fuck I'm trying to say?[SEP][unused10] stop saying \"white\" cops. You're fucking offending white people, if that even matters anymore[SEP][unused10] it's not about race[SEP][unused10] not as evil as white cops executing unarmed Black teens[SEP][unused10] they are the new version of the KKK and they are worse because they are LEGALLY allowed to kill Black citizens.[SEP][unused10] Nobody can reach you because you are brainwashed. Stop being manipulated. You have a brain, use it[SEP][unused10] [unused10] waste of time. This dude is most liking trolling.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] well then you need to talk it up with your people cause they started all this shit worldwide not just in America[SEP][unused10] it's the only case that's exposed by media[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] again, can you provide proof of that sir[SEP][unused10] [unused10] the black teens parents should do a better job with their kid. How do you know he's innocent?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] there you go Tariq. Blame him for it. Because all what's are responsible for what one person does.[SEP][unused10] um..yes it is..that fake website just found a case and made up non existent details in the case[SEP][unused10] and your using the terms black and white[SEP][unused10] so there are no such things as black cops in your mind?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] nope that's reality my friend and trust me I know racism when I see it. Nobody is denying you your rights[SEP][unused10] ask all your white female friends and ask them it their parents wld be ok if they dated someone black. Don't assume. ASK!!!![SEP][unused10] it's on fake radial right/white supremacist sites[SEP][unused10] KKK was started by a black man....Ron Stallworth's....so i guess there are bad in both races. huh.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Have I judged you? Who are \"my people\"? I'm not assuming anybody is \"your people\".[SEP][unused10] but to answer your question [unused11][SEP][unused10] [unused10] no the motivation is that these cops go unpunished for killing unarmed black teens[SEP][unused10] The same for anybody that commits murder as proven in a court of law.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] profiling is real it's not a fucking game dude[SEP][unused10] I'm supposed to have issued a press release about EVERY type of crime ever committed in our history?

HOW EXTREME[SEP][unused10] [unused10] well then I'm not responsible for the crimes committed by other who look like me yet we are constantly profiled[SEP][unused10] [unused10]  Danny, if we stop talking about cancer, will it go away?[SEP][unused10] 1/2 What's the solution? Assume that ALL white people &amp; cops are racist &amp; preach distrust based on the actions of a very few?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I'm not responsible for the actions of others or unrelated people and neither are you.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] think what you want you know damn well how this system is set up[SEP][unused10] you have 2 strikes already. Strike one, u start off debating something that was never said. strike 2 your page is a troll acct[SEP][unused10] do you know what you're doing right now? You're trying to rally blacks against whites. That's pretty evil I must say[SEP][unused10] No, I'm saying let's be reasonable and not let the actions of the few define everybody in that group.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] the article you put up were using the terms \" black\" and \" white\"[SEP][unused10] you said \"with a choke hold\"[SEP][unused10] the best comparative story u can find is of an OFF DUTY black cop getting into an altercation with a white guy...[SEP][unused10] and u want any excuse to deflect from the fact that unarmed black people are getting bashed and kills by racist cops[SEP][unused10] [unused10] My point is..labeling entire groups benefits neither of us gentlemen. Handle stuff case-by-case.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Worcester ma[SEP][unused10] so what should be the punishment for all these white cops beating up and killing unarmed Black people?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] and \"at all costs\" does not apply to twitter debates[SEP][unused10] so you were there on that day and you saw exactly what happened?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Its great he's not corupt but your husband doesn't represent the majority of police officers in America, tho.[SEP][unused10] but they have not stopped it because Unarmed Black people are getting beat up and killed by cops every week now.[SEP]Thatvmayvbebrhe single most asinine tweet I've read all year.
