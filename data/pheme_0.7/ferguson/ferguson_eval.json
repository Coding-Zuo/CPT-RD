(cont) [unused11][SEP][unused10] [unused10] if you can get them to cover all the loss. They'll nickel and dime away.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] so you do admit an unarmed kid was shot right? And fled from where?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] police report says clerk indicated the suspect left and walked TOWARDS quick trip. [unused11][SEP][unused10] [unused10] IDK what to tell ya, the guy says it clearly. Just says Brown wasnt stealing.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] ok yea but I see how I misunderstood[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Me [unused10] mentioned a knee injury, not sure how serious[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] on the other hand, the FBI has a long history of being used as a political tool.

He maybe thought that's why he was being stopped?[SEP][unused10] was there also, seen in video, identified as Dorian Johnson.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] I believe, in cases like this, they are told to not write or say anything that might incriminate...[SEP][unused10] Lots of eye witness accounts right now, guess to your point earlier, probably won't ever know truth for sure.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] based on history over last 5 year's, and that area. He gets (cont) [unused11][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] That's not true... + the cop had no idea he was \"involved\" in a cigar robbery + none on him[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] It does happen ... happened here in HI 3 years ago on street, cop just got off this week, nothing.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] so I instead of chasing someone for a Jay walking citation (cont) [unused11][SEP][unused10] [unused10] I will never put any physical property over human loss. Even a car wreck, I say, well at least you're alive.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] police report has zip code of robbery as 63135. Only quik trips in the area are 63136[SEP][unused10] [unused10] one thing I disagree with that guy in that video about is Brown didnt look like he did nothing. Grabbed clerk...[SEP][unused10] [unused10] well either way it had nothing to do with the shooting, so it's irrelevant[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Which, given the circumstances, I chuckle at those individuals -- bc it's clear they can't handle it[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused11] --- try that link Greg[SEP][unused10] [unused10] clearly says he was at Ferguson Market...[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Well, that's the problem... This PD was already under federal investigation for shit like this.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] it's a bad situation in many ways. Other innocents affected.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Yup, 5th amendment rights; didn't file paperwork either[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] and who's account was that? The officer's? Bc there's no dash cam video for some strange reason[SEP][unused10] if out was him, and he was picked up. How much time would he have gotten? 0, first (cont) [unused11][SEP][unused10] I'm wondering if that maybe contributed to the struggle starting? Of course we'll never know the answer for sure.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] and I call BS on anything they say, and don't believe he was inv the car. How much sense does that even make?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] insurance covers a building and the goods inside.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] but again, stealing cigars imo, arguing with a cop, etc. Hitting a cop, once hands went up, incident over[SEP][unused10] [unused10] by the shirt and shoved him, clerk was trying to stop him. But that doesnt justify death by any means.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I seen it yesterday. And talked to people who spoke to him[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] makes sense...[SEP][unused10] from what I gather, he was walking down street, kneeled down with hands in air before being shot. No struggle.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] wouldn't open. But I saw 2 witnesses that said different[SEP][unused10] [unused10] if the feds could surveil the entire US and world, there would never be any fugitives.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Given the circumstances, it's a good thing -- unless you're a State Rights \"they can handle it\", guy[SEP][unused10] He left an illness call to take a robbery call in the area, according to the Police Chief. Wrong robbery, wrong robber? Just sayin[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Who shot into the car? I took it that the cop shot into his own car while trying to get out, causing Brown to kneel[SEP][unused10] [unused10] robbery suspect at the Quik Trip, but that isnt where it happened. Clerk said suspect left store and went that way.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] of course not, we've reiterated that. But a Quik Trip was burned down because of this, hope it wasnt a franchise.[SEP][unused10] #MichaelBrown new that he had just committed a serious crime.  That is key in establishing #MichaelBrowns state of mind.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] me neither, just saying the situation is bad in many ways.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] especially if he did nothing wrong... Why wouldn't he write it and give his story while fresh[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I know it can be done, but you may be right in that the cams would already need to be focused there.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] if the guy got shot and fled, where did the dead body come from?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] so is it 100% proven that that's him in the video? Guy in video looks 50 pounds heavier to me[SEP][unused10] OK I misunderstood it. No struggle, but Brown was in the police car at one point.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] it just sounds like his friend in the video has bad info of where the robbery happened. Cop went looking for the...[SEP][unused10] [unused10] yes, that's what I understood[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] every single witness account is exact same. Only different 1 is the cop [unused11][SEP][unused10] [unused10] ok I got it wrong[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] how many bullets did Mike Brown take - like 6 or 7? No pictures of an ambulance on the scene either[SEP][unused10] [unused10] That's some messed up shit man. Walking down street. Cop goes in reverse. Shoots on way out of car. Then murders kid[SEP][unused10] [unused10] didn't know it was burned down? I'm not OK with that at all... still not my main concern or focus.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] that's what I wonder, but this guy says Brown was in the car [unused11][SEP][unused10] IDK officers responding to the theft say they never found suspect until he was dead, identified him as Brown and his friend...[SEP][unused10] furthermore, if he was shot twice while fleeing, in flip flops by the way. When he (cont) [unused11][SEP][unused10] [unused10] by writing the report, he'd be providing evidence against himself.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] the cop shot out the car at Mr. Brown, then got out car and shot again[SEP][unused10] [unused10] that's BS too imo[SEP][unused10] [unused10] so y'all saying 2 different stories. Looking at same video?[SEP]Then why did that officer have contact [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] Yeah, he was saying it was a different store...[SEP][unused10] [unused10] yea Police chief admitted Wilson didnt know about the robbery.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] watch again. You heard wrong[SEP][unused10] [unused10] but that's me. If I'm wrong then I can live with that.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] what's justice? He's dead. There is no justice... And can't be any justice...[SEP][unused10] [unused10] they dont have satellite imagery of everywhere. Thats physically impossible.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] I believe the witness accounts heard 7+ ... 7 bullets needed for a kneeling unarmed 18 yr old?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] and as we've seen already. This police force is very (cont) [unused11][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Yep, before this happened, already under fed investigation for racial profiling / brutality etc.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] who didn't even write the incident report of his version of accounts[SEP][unused10] [unused10] what satellite cam?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] wouldn't be so bad if they weren't already under federal interest cases[SEP][unused10] [unused10] You don't think the FBI can pull up satellite video of any corner of the globe they wanted to?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Yup. Question is, which citizens have video evidence? OR better yet, will FBI have ability to pull up satellite cam?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] witness from the video admitted Brown was there. That much I didnt misunderstand lol[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] the witness accounts I've read all say the same thing.

Great tweets btw[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Why didn't they shoot the White Protesters at #BundyRanch for also aiming guns at Federal Officials?[SEP][unused10] The narrative initially seemed to be that the county police were coming in to take over for smaller/compromised Ferguson PD.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Any talk about the Nat'l Guard or Feds coming in to break this crap up &amp; make the local Police stand down?[SEP]WaPo Reporter asked who he was more afraid of. \u201c[unused10] .[unused10] easy answer, i'm a black man - the police\u201d[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Nevada.

History of voter intimidation? Who participates in local Dem/Republican parties?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Second this question--I grew up in Ferg 1974-84 and am also thinking abt how Ferg's history intertwines w/Kinloch's.[SEP][unused10] By whose orders? Who is in charge?

[unused11][SEP][unused10] omg really?

Who is running that? How our officers from other units viewing this situation?[SEP][unused10] I'd love someone to do some deep profiling on city manager, mayor, police admin--really go through archives of local press[SEP][unused10] have you seen any state legislators? Besides the one Senator. Anything from MO Senators.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I did not, available on line?[SEP][unused10] Who is paying for this display of 'strength'?

Do crowd dynamics change? The ratio of residents:outsiders. R witnesses afraid2talk2police?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Are media asking why SWAT teams are necessary?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] guns can't me armed, did you mean \"loaded assault rifles\"?[SEP][unused10] What about local leaders in the crowd who are emerging as important to the demonstrations?

Or even be frowned upon?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Thanks, you're right.[SEP][unused10] what is legality militarized police policing? Feds have to sign off on? Are Federal discussions happening around #Ferguson?[SEP][unused10] protests have been majority black (as is the city/surrounding area), but there have been people of many races - including white[SEP][unused10] What about the officer who yelled at protestors, \"Bring it, f*cking animals, bring it! Is he being disciplined for incitement?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] my question is, what is their endgame? Or are they just deploying a full on occupation? #greetedAsLiberators[SEP][unused10] what is the population in #Ferguson? How big/small off a town?[SEP][unused10] is there still a need for such an aggressive police presence at this point? I tweeted earlier #Ferguson needs a Gen Honore[SEP][unused10] U talking about the pieces of shit at #BundyRanch that had assault weapons aimed at Cops?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] good question, but we are talking about different sets of cops/Feds.[SEP][unused10] I'm interested in pastors with mostly white flocks -- are they engaged, and with whom? [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] ? Why wow?[SEP].[unused10] at night the place becomes a bit of a warzone - tear gas doesn't discriminate between protestor/rioter/reporter[SEP][unused10] It may be too narrow for a natl audience, but how this plays into local STL City-County divide &amp; merger debate is fascinating[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I don't know. Maybe [unused10] does. He's reporting #Ferguson live right now.[SEP].[unused10] part of distinction there is that county/state police are the ones helping police protests - not just Ferguson PD[SEP][unused10] I'm actually very curious about the apparent media blackout, at least at night. How is that playing w journalists?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Well yeah, but attny for key eye witness said they were stonewalled when tryin to come forward w/ info[SEP][unused10] [unused10] i haven't encountered them on the ground, but doesn't mean they aren't here[SEP][unused10] [unused10] anything Brown family would like outsiders to do in support?[SEP].[unused10] correct.

Do police generally have to draw their guns?[SEP][unused10] what's the local tax structure &amp; public funding been like for the last few years? How did 2008 fin. crisis effect it &amp; whom?[SEP][unused10] how spread out (1 block, several blocks, etc) are these protests?[SEP][unused10] Reports say FBI, DOJ investigating but they don't prosecute murder. Plz explain what fed involvement can &amp; can't do[SEP][unused10] Which makes you more nervous out there protestors or PD?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] (2/2) circumstances such a show of force is used. Is it when someone (who) declares state of emergency. Or[SEP][unused10] The difficulty in crafting a plausible narrative explaining this is prob why #Ferguson PD hasn't released the # of gunshots.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] LA Times reporter [unused10] has done work with a state senator (?) on ground, if I remember correctly.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] African American.But while pop transitioned, the town leadership, school board stayed white.

You've been doing some of the most fair and honest coverage I've seen.[SEP][unused10] How can they be unanswered? I thought this happened in broad daylight. No one else was on the street? In the vicinity?![SEP][unused10] [unused10] Any Black female leadership in Ferguson?

Do they feel like this is a legitimate display of force?[SEP][unused10] What is the MO governor doing?[SEP][unused10] okay... Thanks. Just curious about that part as it hasn't been mentioned anymore since day of shooting.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Aside from visible racial homogeneity of police &amp; city council, is there evidence/examples of ingrained racism?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Just RT'd [unused10] tweet w/ link to text of his speech in #Ferguson so you can check my feed.

Be glad you have them.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] We escaped a Communist country where our land was stolen/friends imprisoned &amp; never looked back.[SEP][unused10] We have to teach people to not become dependent on big government.

Report responsibly please , not fair to others man[SEP][unused10] They are, and most people are saddened and troubled by that. And most blacks are killed by other blacks. [unused10][SEP][unused10] I understand, but let's be honest there is a moral crisis in black America. 70+ % out of wedlock birthdate! [unused10][SEP][unused10] agree that there is an absolute crisis of morality in the black community, and has been so for several decades [unused10][SEP][unused10] Blacks ARE victims of big government, leftist, progressive ideas and policies!

Before 1964 blacks marriage rate was higher than whites.[SEP][unused10] LOL I thought I was the only who had that problem! [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] AMEN. It is what takes the place of fathers and husbands in broken communities.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] He did NOT have a past, he had a FUTURE. Check your research. That was in the first report! Carry on.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] No assumption, turn your tv on. I'm a black mother of 3 young men, and an educator; black men are being killed![SEP][unused10] They will have to soon, will they not? I would imagine it will be released with the County Police Commissioners report.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] and 85% of whites kill whites, but white men are not under seige. Ask blacks who commit crimes, not me![SEP][unused10] Life is hard for everyone. [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] reason nothing changes is 2 many people r 2 busy claiming victim status instead of working hard.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] look at the stats for certain crimes.  Federal prison is overwhelmingly white for white collar crimes.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] those are the ones that need help from the system! Folks that worked and fell on hard times![SEP][unused10] If there were more intact homes, then there would be less of need for a police presence.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] need more leaders that stress gd choices, not ones who promote strife and victimhood.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] just really sad how the tables are trying to be turned, but the truth is not transparent. There's something deeper.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] that there is a HUGE other problem! Trust me, I spend countless hours mentoring about that![SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] YOU are responsible for your choices. not someone else. OWN IT. no one holds you back, stops u.[SEP][unused10] [unused10]  WHY not wait for robbery of store report to be released w/everything too. Info released sides w/cop's story.[SEP][unused10] Me too! Much love and repect to all who participated in this conversation. [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] It all comes back to slavery? [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] exactly. I hate when the focus is taken off of the issue to talk about black on black crime. Smh.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Crimes go unsolved cuz folks r taught that 'snitches get stitches' &amp; that cops hate u. Vicious cycle. (Cont'd)[SEP]Y\u2019all notice #Ferguson &amp; St Louis county have NOT released the autopsy report. Trajectory of bullets matters in death of #MikeBrown[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Im not making anything personal. that is general comments aimed at the issue.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] and THAT has nothing to do with race. Has EVERYTHING to do with families and values.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] no prejudice and hate divides the country, but those are the foundations that this country was built on.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] start rebuilding fams, teaching morals, find God, pursue education, teach hard work pays.[SEP][unused10] I agree completely! But we also need a full investigation of what happened in #Ferguson. [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10]  If the dispatch timeline matches that point we do agree. STILL not justify shooting.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] My wife is yelling at me for still tweeting but had to check out trailer. Looks awesome. Will buy.[SEP][unused10] Well said! Those are eternal principles upon which we can all build our lives upon! [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] a close personal friend went from losing a job and everything, to being homeless.[SEP][unused10] it's shocking how ur stirring things up b4 facts come out, one would think you've learned that lesson- sad story though[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I hear that phrase in my white neighborhood. It's not just a BLACK issue. They do it on Capital Hill TOO![SEP][unused10] Amen! [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] I'm not justifying cops who go overboard however.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] No doubt. No one wants renegade cops shooting w/out cause. Facts need to come out 1st before we indict anyone.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] oh you think blacks arent able to get married or considered human? stupid tweet of the day award![SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] not only dont want to have, but openly try to silence and stop dead in its tracks.[SEP][unused10] Yes it does.  Which is why most reasonable people have advocated waiting for ALL facts before jumping to conclusions.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] when babies are mealtickets, we have a problem. when men father and abandon fams we have a problem[SEP][unused10] They don't want the ENTIRE truth to come out; only the information to demonize #MichaelBrown...as if their kids are perfect.[SEP][unused10] not stirring up Jack.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] There are plenty of chances to succeed, just look at college aid, affirm action. work hard, own it[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] I agree. It all starts w/ breakdown of family, which leads to bad morals, NO MATTER WHAT RACE.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] The issue is 'self defense' or 'murder'? Just like Trayvon. Not race. Media &amp; race hustlers change focus.[SEP][unused10] trajectory, number of injuries, entrance points[SEP][unused10] but that is for EVERY RACE IN AMERICA, not just blacks.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Lol! I just said that yesterday! Those on the system make politicians RICH!!![SEP][unused10] [unused10] Come on Crystal, u know 'stop snitching' is a big problem in the black community: [unused11][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] =)[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] ask irish about their history when they got here. tell me they had it gd. or jews. stop being vics[SEP][unused10] And we will have to stand before God one day to give account of our lives. We can't blame others. [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] thanks for great convo, all, i appreciate the honest discourse and very civil tone have a gr8 day![SEP][unused10] we've got to start with the atrocities of killing black men first. There has never been rioting were real peace lived first.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] i want a healthy, happy, strong, moral America, regardless of what race, creed or color you are.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] behind every successful family is a proud, strong supportive hard working wife.[SEP][unused10] My wife is black, and we have 2 kids together. I only want the best for everybody, but if we can't agree that..[unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] It ALLLLLL plays a part. There is always a starting point, the history of a problem.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] 94% of all blacks killed are killed by other blacks. Where are the protests for that? [unused11][SEP][unused10] No doubt, but blaming others &amp; not taking personal responsibility has multiplied problems for blacks. [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] Lots of white people want to know the truth, and care about justice, so why would you even assume that? [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] No doubt there r bad cops. I've met some. But most r risking their lives, 4 little pay in hostile neighbohoods[SEP][unused10] [unused10] &amp; I just can't stand the race hustlers like Al, Black Panthers &amp; Jesse always dividing the country. Sick of it[SEP][unused10] then I don't think this conversation can go any further. [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] EVERYBODY will have to atone for the part they play. EVERYONE.[SEP][unused10] I want you check out this documentary [unused11] Please and Thanks! [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] This is the conversation on responsible choices that too many on the Left do not want us to have.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] every race in AMERICA has moral issues! It's not just a problem of Black morals.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Absolutely,  but this is not the case of #MichaelBrown. The focus needs to be on a dead, unarmed black man.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] It's \"odd\"what info the #Ferguson cops release while\"investigating!\"Seems self-serving;prelim autopsy?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Seriously? We ALL know that!How many shots hit his body,where,how close,etc.Again,unarmed  w/hands up?#Ferguson[SEP][unused10] Good point![SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] when killing someone for sneakers or drugs is acceptable, we have a problem.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] but just like all sin, there is a ROOT.[SEP][unused10] So you don't think the welfare state plays a role in this, or personal responsibility? [unused10] [unused10][SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] ABSOLUTELY! There is a difference between living off of the government and CARING for the REAL POOR.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Blacks are under siege by who? Cops have to police areas of ppl that r taught to hate cops. (Cont'd)[SEP][unused10] what you want is the full autopsy report. That won't be released until the investigation is over. [unused10][SEP][unused10] sincerely, that was not my intent. There are alot of whites joining in with tears. Not my intention to make anyone think that.[SEP][unused10] when will an arrest take place? #Ferguson[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] I mentor about that EVERYDAY!
