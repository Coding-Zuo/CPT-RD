Just ignorant.  People in the west care more about sports.  Myself included.  It keeps us blind.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I invite you to learn about cognitive bias, in group/out group thinking and rationalization before you die.  The truth.[SEP][unused10] I guess you haven't read your own Quran or Islamic history, because thousands have died and continue to die in the name of Islam.[SEP][unused10] Allah says that if you kill an innocent person it's as if you've killed all of mankind. No one dies in the name of Islam.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] ive met a lot of good christians, but plenty of them have been rude and hateful to me as well. muslims have not.[SEP][unused10] It's hard convincing one who comes from Oriental Orthodoxy, we've been getting killed from the beginning to now and not vice versa.[SEP][unused10] no one is ever killed in the name of Islam. Those aren't Muslims .. Those are extremists - huge difference[SEP][unused10] [unused10] muslims are not taught to hate. that is an absurd notion people try to spread; ain't the case.[SEP][unused10] Hold on, so in that specific time, they were muslims. But now theyre just evil? Load of rubbish[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] have you read it? You should read it if you have not... cover to cover, not cliffs notes.[SEP][unused10] Faith is stupid.  And sometimes evil.  And they make nice churches but the faith itself is ugly.  Never beautiful.  Never.[SEP][unused10] I also want to let you know my problem is the faith and not the people, most of the people are nice people.[SEP][unused10] Learn about myths. your emperics are poisoning this world too.[SEP][unused10] Not sure how a Christian would call Islam \"a beautiful faith\"when its origin is the spirit of Antichrist.Demonic is not beautiful.[SEP][unused10] believe it r not when charles made this comment many asses got fired lol. n i know dat truth hurts u very much[unused10][SEP][unused10] not anti fsa, not a supporter of isis though, although when maliki was killing innocent Muslim protestors with barrel bombs[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Yes I have read the Koran from cover to cover in translation. And it isn't beautiful. The Bible is.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] is anyone calling this Islam? Seriously? That would be crazy and proof of a lack of intelligence.[SEP][unused10] I could go kill in the name of \"Christianity\" .. Does that mean I'm a Christian? No because Christianity doesn't promote violence[SEP][unused10] daily nobody cared, once isis did what it did till now in Iraq suddenly everyone is a human rights activist. Hypocrites.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] I agree[SEP][unused10] Thank you, but no thank you.[SEP][unused10] do you know what I mean when I say that? I mean that no one has died because Islam said they had to die.[SEP][unused10] You can't conflate criticism of a faith with hatred or bigotry.[SEP][unused10] if it's such an evil religion why would it be the fastest growing religion today? Why would people convert to Islam?[SEP][unused10] I would never even try to learn, it's an evil faith.[SEP][unused10] thank you :)[SEP][unused10] lulz[SEP][unused10] I know he does, but there are about 109 verses commanding to kill [unused11] The quran contradicts itself.[SEP][unused10] No.  They're saving it.
