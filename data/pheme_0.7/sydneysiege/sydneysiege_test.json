The poor get nothing.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Like I said, moral obligation of drivers to give rides to those in danger is independent of pricing[SEP][unused10] [unused10] And the beauty of surge pricing is that it immediately gets a bunch of people in a car, and then prices will drop.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] yes...because only the ppl with the $$ are the \"really needy\"...such a non real life way to look at things[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Encourage people to do as much charity as possible, then let the marketplace fill in the gaps.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] But then why would they provide a service if they're not making any money?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Both are the same to economists: A supply shortage due to an external intervention in the market.[SEP][unused10] stick to baseball[SEP][unused10] [unused10] you continue to compare day to day events to a rare unprecedented event.

You're trying to find moral meaning in math equations.[SEP][unused10] I just deleted the ap.

What's your solution?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Well as u might surmise it's an issue I think people r consistently wrong about in a pernicious way[SEP][unused10] [unused10] And by the way, people are free to do that in Sydney RIGHT NOW. Uber's prices will drop immediately in response.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] When there's 1 cab for every 10 people who want to get picked up in Sydney, who do they think gets picked up?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] Is it reasonable to expect them to give everyone cheap rides just in case a relative wants one? No.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] I don't give a shit about their marginal revenue. I think ur proposal makes scared people worse off[SEP][unused10] beyond price gouging, their use of user data has been poor at best too. Why use this service again?[SEP].[unused10] The idea of surge pricing makes people uncomfortable, but it's the market providing a good to those that need it most.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] The higher the price more likely such a decision would be made. Why do u think ur price is \"better\"?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] criticizing them for this is wrongheaded on so many levels. how many rides would be available if [unused10] didn't exist?[SEP][unused10] yes[SEP][unused10] is it inconceivable that someone could read the article, understand the laws of supply and demand, and still disagree with practices?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] It has nothing to do with drivers being greedy. It's a computer code. It's pure #math.[SEP][unused10] It's all about the fans, man.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Some rich, desperate people get cabs for $100, and then within a half hour prices drop down to normal levels.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] In an emergency, you need a system to encourage drivers on the road and make sure only the really needy grab cabs.[SEP]\u201c[unused10] Uber is a pile of garbage. [unused11]\u201d people hate on Uber but people keep using the service.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] same pay to drivers so they're helping \"get drivers on the street\"[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] That's almost certainly false. But only Uber has data 2 say, so at least your assertion is unfounded[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] It decreases the supply of rides for desperate people when they are most needed[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Uber is acting as if they have no choice...they have a choice[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] whole point of surge pricing is: many want 2 be w family now. Why *ration* rides now of all times?[SEP][unused10] [unused10] The only way to do that is with pricing mechanisms (i.e. \"surge pricing\"). It's not immoral, it's amoral.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Except the irony is that the people helped by the surge pricing are the people Jonah thinks it hurts: The consumers.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] Charity is wonderful. But pretending the whole world can work on charity rather than free markets is fantasy land.[SEP][unused10] [unused10] [unused10] [unused10] This does not increase the supply of drivers, only raises the piece for scared riders.[SEP][unused10] I\u2019m not sure I understand what there is to disagree w/.
